# FE20-CR2-JulianeJohannsen
This is a project from the bootcamp at CodeFactory Vienna. 
The task was to create a responsive weekly planner page with tasks. Usage of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap was required. A photo as guidance for the design of the page was given.
The task elements of the page should be created by JavaScript (objects). Every task should contain a button that represents the priority level of the task, increased on click. 
The priority level should extend from 0 to 5, for 0 and 1 the button should be green, for 2 and 3 yellow, for 4 and 5 red. 
Finally a sort button on top of the tasks should sort the tasks according to their chosen priority level.
